    /**
     1-  Create a cucumber project from scratch. Design all packages, classes and ohter files...
     2- Navigate to https://www.saucedemo.com/
     3-Login with valid credentials (shown on the page)
     4-Sort the products high to  low
     5- Add to cart at least two item
     6- Assert that the basket shows the true number of product
     7-Navigate to Your cart page
     8-Assert that the right items added to cart
     9-go to checkout page and fill the form
     10-click continue button and go to the checkout overview page
     11-Assert the price of items
     12-Click finish and assert the success shopping message

     notes:     a. every new page should be asserted by page title
     b. to have maximum step with minimum method  use the parameterized methods.
     c. This is an e2e test so u can create one feature for this task called success shopping but login
     feature should be designed seperately.

     last note: negative login tests are optinal....maybe we can add these step later.
     good luck.
